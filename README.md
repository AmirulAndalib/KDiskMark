# KDiskMark Legacy
You are in the assistive branch to package the application.

The main branch: https://github.com/JonMagon/KDiskMark

## Why not a build flag?

The current version of KDiskMark is completely incompatible with packaging in a standalone application format. The introduction of the build flag causes very confusing code, so I decided to create this separate branch that would support the old code with some of the new code. Versioning follows the main branch.
